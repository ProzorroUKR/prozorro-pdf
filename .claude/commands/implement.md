# Implement

Follow the `Workflow` to implement the `PATH_TO_PLAN` then `Report` the completed work.

## Instructions

- IMPORTANT: Implement the plan top to bottom, in order. Do not skip any steps. Do not stop in between steps. Complete every step in the plan before stopping.
  - Make your best guess judgement based on the plan, everything will be detailed there.
  - If you have not run any validation commands throughout your implementation, DO NOT STOP until you have validated the work.
  - Your implementation should end with executing the validation commands to validate the work, if there are issues, fix them before stopping.

## Project-Specific Implementation Patterns

When implementing in this codebase, follow these mandatory rules:

### Module Structure Rules

- **Feature modules** → `src/modules/<type-kebab>/` — Each document type is a self-contained module (loader, document maker, `services/*.builder.ts`, `config/`, `constants/`, `<type>.module.ts` descriptor, `index.ts`). New document types go here, NOT in `src/widgets/`.
- **Core services** → `src/services/ServiceName/` — Cross-cutting services (PDF pipeline, DataTypeValidator, DictionaryCollector, Dom, Common, Sign)
- **Utilities** → `src/utils/` — Shared utility functions (DateHandler, StringHandler, Base64, etc.)
- **Types** → `src/types/` — TypeScript type definitions grouped by domain
- **Config** → `src/config/` — Global configuration (fonts, PDF styles); module-local texts live in the module's `config/`
- **Constants** → `src/constants/` — Shared constants (enums, regex, HTTP codes)
- **Widgets** → `src/widgets/` — Cross-cutting helpers only (e.g. `ErrorExceptionCore`), not document types

### Code Patterns

- **Language**: Pure TypeScript (no Vue, no React, no framework)
- **Classes vs functions**: Services and widgets use classes; utilities use plain functions
- **Interfaces**: Use interfaces for service contracts (e.g., `*Interface.ts`, `*StrategyInterface.ts`)
- **Strategies/Factories**: Document types are described by `PdfFeatureModule` descriptors (`src/modules/types.ts`); the core pipeline builds its maps from them (`DocumentFactory`, `LoaderFactory`, `ModuleRegistry`). Register a new type by adding its descriptor to `pdfFeatureModules` in `src/modules/index.ts` — do NOT look for `LoaderStrategyMap.ts`/`DocumentStrategyMap.ts`/`pdfDictionaryMap.ts`, they do not exist.
- **No hardcoding**: Keep document-specific text in the module's `config/` (dictionaries/texts), not inside loader/maker classes.

### Architecture Constraints

- ✓ Modules/services can use `src/utils/`, `src/config/`, `src/constants/`
- ✓ Services can call other services
- ✗ No circular dependencies — `ModuleRegistry` reads `pdfFeatureModules` lazily via getters to avoid import TDZ; keep that pattern
- Public API exports go through `src/main.ts` only

### Design Decisions

- **When to create a feature module**: For a new Prozorro document type — one module under `src/modules/<type>/`
- **When to create a service**: When logic is shared across multiple modules/documents
- **When to create a utility**: When it's a pure transformation function used broadly
- **Config vs constants**: Use `config/` for runtime-used configurations, `constants/` for compile-time values

### Standard Implementation Phases

1. **Types** — Add to `src/types/` if new domain types are needed
2. **Config/Constants** — Add to the module's `config/`/`constants/`, or `src/config/`/`src/constants/` if global
3. **Module** — Create/extend `src/modules/<type>/` (loader, document maker, builders, descriptor)
4. **Register** — Add the descriptor to `pdfFeatureModules` in `src/modules/index.ts`
5. **Export** — Add to `src/main.ts` if it's part of the public API
6. **Validation** — Run lint, tests, build

### Validation Commands

```bash
npm run lint:scripts           # ESLint TypeScript linting
npm run test                   # Run vitest unit tests
npm run build:lib              # Full library build (tsc + vite)
npm run format                 # Auto-fix formatting with Prettier
```

## The Iron Law

```
NO COMPLETION CLAIM WITHOUT VERIFIED EVIDENCE
```

Claiming completion without running validation? Start over.

**No exceptions:**

- Don't claim "should work" - prove it works
- Don't trust previous run results - run again
- Don't skip validation "this once"
- Evidence or it didn't happen

## Verification Gate (MANDATORY)

BEFORE claiming implementation is complete:

1. **IDENTIFY**: What validation commands prove completion?
2. **RUN**: Execute EVERY validation command (fresh, complete)
3. **READ**: Full output - check exit codes, count failures
4. **VERIFY**: Does ALL output confirm success?
   - If NO: Fix issues, re-run, repeat
   - If YES: Include evidence in report
5. **ONLY THEN**: Claim completion

Skip any step = incomplete implementation. Return to Step 1.

**Evidence required for completion claim:**

- Validation command output (actual output, not "it passed")
- Test results with pass/fail counts
- Git diff summary

## Red Flags - STOP Implementation

If any of these thoughts occur to you, STOP and reconsider:

- Writing code before reading relevant files
- Skipping validation "because code looks correct"
- "I'll fix the tests later"
- Committing without running checks
- "Just a small change, no need to verify"
- Using "should work" or "probably passes"
- Claiming completion before running commands
- Trusting previous run results

**If any of these apply: STOP. Run validation commands NOW.**

## Common Rationalizations

| Excuse                       | Reality                                        |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| "Code is obviously correct"  | Obvious code fails all the time. Verify.       |
| "Tests were passing earlier" | Previous runs prove nothing. Run again.        |
| "Just a small change"        | Small changes break things. Full verification. |
| "I'll test it later"         | Later never comes. Test now.                   |
| "The plan said to do this"   | Plans can be wrong. Verify outcomes.           |

## Announcement (MANDATORY)

Before starting work, announce:

"I'm using /implement to implement the plan at [path]. I will follow the workflow exactly and verify all work before claiming completion."

This creates commitment. Skipping this step = likely to skip other steps.

## Variables

PATH_TO_PLAN: $ARGUMENTS

## Workflow

- If no `PATH_TO_PLAN` is provided, STOP immediately and ask the user to provide it.

  **No exceptions:**
  - Don't infer the plan from conversation
  - Don't create an ad-hoc plan
  - Don't proceed without an explicit path
  - STOP means STOP

- Read the plan at `PATH_TO_PLAN`. Ultrathink about the plan and IMPLEMENT it into the codebase.
  - Implement the entire plan top to bottom before stopping.

## Report

- Summarize the work you've just done in a concise bullet point list.
- Report the files and total lines changed with `git diff --stat`
